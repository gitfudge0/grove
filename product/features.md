# Feature behavior

Read the relevant section when changing file categories, plans or HTML reports.

## Change categories

Grove groups changed files under Code, Tests, Docs, and Config. Unrecognized file types appear under Uncategorized. Classification uses paths and filenames, never an AI guess about the intent of a change. A file belongs to exactly one parent and optionally one subcategory. Parents include files without a subcategory; there is no Other row.

Populated parents appear in the checkout card, even when only one parent is present. The arrow expands populated subcategories. Clicking a parent or child opens its filtered diff. Expansion is local to the selected checkout. New file and mapping changes are picked up by the existing status refresh.

Built-in subcategories recognize Tests → Unit, Integration, End-to-end, Fixtures & snapshots; Config → Dependencies & lockfiles, Build & tooling, CI/CD, Deployment & infrastructure, Environment & app settings; Code → Scripts & automation, Assets. Generic test filenames remain under Tests without guessing unit versus integration. Unit and integration directory names require test context. Bare JSON/YAML/TOML and arbitrary dotfiles do not imply Config. Test and docs context takes priority over extensions.

### Optional repository mappings

Create `.grove/change-categories.json` in each checkout. No mapping is required. For example:

```json
{
  "rules": [
    { "path": "src/views/special.rs", "category": "code", "subcategory": "Special UI" },
    { "path": "src/views/", "category": "code", "subcategory": "UI" },
    { "path": "resources/settings.json", "category": "config" }
  ]
}
```

Rules run in array order, before built-in conventions; the first match wins. Paths are case-sensitive, relative to the checkout, and use `/`. A trailing slash matches that directory's descendants; otherwise the match is exact. `src/views/` does not match `src/views-old/`. Globs and absolute or parent-relative paths are unsupported. Put specific rules before broader directory rules. Valid categories are `code`, `tests`, `docs`, `config`, and `uncategorized`. Omit `subcategory` to keep files directly in the parent. Custom subcategory labels must be nonempty, contain no control characters, and be at most 64 bytes.

Files are limited to 64 KiB and 256 rules. A missing mapping uses built-ins. An unreadable or invalid mapping logs a warning and falls back to built-ins as a whole; it never removes changed files from the summary or diff. Overrides are read as data and execute no commands. Commit the mapping to share it with teammates and future worktrees.


## Native plans

Plans render inline as Markdown. Author a `.grove-plan.json` envelope and link its absolute path in a completed assistant message:

```json
{
  "schema_version": 1,
  "plan_id": "search-performance",
  "revision_id": "r1",
  "title": "Make search responsive",
  "markdown": "# Make search responsive\n\nMove indexing off the input thread.\n\n## Approach\n1. Measure the current path.\n2. Move indexing into a worker.\n3. Ignore stale results.\n\n## Verification\nCompare matching and ranking; measure input-to-paint latency."
}
```

The Markdown field contains the complete readable plan. Use headings, lists, tables, fenced code and file links; scale detail to the task. Ask consequential questions in the document and collect answers through plan feedback. Do not author HTML or claim/exhibit trees for new plans. The envelope retains immutable identity and native review/approval controls. Change the revision ID when content changes. Limits remain 1 MiB per document and 64 KiB per text field.

The conversation renders the complete Markdown. The right-panel **Plan** section lists the latest revision of each plan, including approved plans, as references for current work. Hover opens the same document in an anchored peek; crossing into it preserves the peek, click pins it, and Escape restores source focus. The inline document remains readable while its peek is open.

**Review response** previews exact canonical feedback. Explicit **Send response** sends it to the owning session; feedback never authorizes implementation. **Approve & implement** is a separate explicit action bound to the current immutable revision. Queues, delivery journals, duplicate protection and composer draft preservation remain unchanged.

Existing structured plans remain importable and convert to Markdown for reading. Legacy decisions retain native answer controls and explicit-answer approval gates. Their original stored documents are never rewritten.

Verification must name both **Codex and Claude**. Core tests establish import, persistence, revision and delivery contracts; native fixtures establish only the exercised UI behavior. Neither establishes live provider-boundary behavior. Inspect inline Markdown, latest-revision hover/pinning, source focus, narrow widths and zoom with real native rendering; report unavailable platforms and live checks explicitly.


## Integrated HTML reports

An agent can return a report that reads as part of the conversation rather than
a framed document. Ordinary HTML previews are unchanged.

### Contract

A complete HTML document (`<!doctype html>` or `<html>` through `</html>`, at
most 2 MiB) opts in with the exact comment `<!-- grove:integrated-report -->`.
It reaches the transcript the same way as any HTML preview: a closed fenced
`html` block, or a Markdown link to a local `.html` file.

Grove injects one `<style id="grove-report-theme">` element and replaces its
contents whenever appearance or UI zoom changes, without reloading the document.
Colours come from `src/theme.rs`; sizes come from `src/views/tokens.rs` at the
current zoom.

| Variable | Source |
|---|---|
| `--grove-bg`, `--grove-fg`, `--grove-muted` | `BG`, `FG`, `FG_DIM` |
| `--grove-surface`, `--grove-border` | `BG_HOVER`, `BORDER` |
| `--grove-info`, `--grove-success`, `--grove-warning` | `BLUE`, `GREEN`, `AMBER` |
| `--grove-body`, `--grove-title`, `--grove-display` | `TEXT_BODY`, `TEXT_DISPLAY`, `TEXT_DISPLAY_LG` |
| `--grove-gap`, `--grove-section`, `--grove-radius` | `SPACE_LG`, `SPACE_20`, `RADIUS_GROUP` |
| `--grove-font` | Bundled DM Sans UI family |

The injected rules also set the root background, colour, font and size, zero the
body margin, and hide root overflow while the report is inline.

Claude and Codex learn this contract from Grove's injected session guidance
(`crates/grove-core/src/reports.rs`). `examples/integrated-report.html` is a
sample.

### Behaviour

- Inline, the report has no frame or title; a compact action row keeps Preview,
  Source, Reload (fenced reports), Expand and browser actions.
- The native view is sized to the measured body height, capped at eight times
  the standard preview height. Expand shows longer reports in full.
- Wheel input over an inline report scrolls the conversation. Expanded, the
  document scrolls itself.
- Document state (tabs, filters, inputs) survives Expand and Source toggles.
  Reload and restart reset it. Opening in a browser uses the original file,
  which does not receive Grove's theme.

### Platform boundaries

Height is pulled by the host: every 100 ms the view requests a read-only
evaluation of the body height and receives a single finite number.

| Platform | Wheel forwarding |
|---|---|
| macOS (WKWebView) | The web view passes wheel events to the GPUI host view. No document messages. |
| Linux (WebKitGTK, X11) | GTK scroll events are captured in-process and dispatched into the GPUI window during the GTK pump. No document messages. |
| Windows (WebView2) | WebView2 is out of process and does not return wheel input, so a host script posts wheel deltas. Web messages are enabled for this alone: the host accepts only finite, clamped wheel deltas from a visible inline report and ignores every other message. |

The existing sandbox otherwise applies unchanged: CSP, blocked network and file
requests, no host objects, no workers, no popups.

### Authoring limits

Avoid viewport-height layouts, inner scroll areas, fixed or sticky positioning,
body margins, and `!important` overrides of the injected rules. Embedded DOM text uses bundled DM Sans, with JetBrains Mono for semantic or authored monospace text. Font choices are normalized, including dynamically inserted text. Platform glyph fallback remains available for unsupported characters. Text drawn inside authored canvas/bitmap assets is intrinsic content.

### Verification

```sh
cargo test --bin grove views::inline_html::tests
clang -fobjc-arc -fblocks scripts/verify-integrated-report-webkit.m \
  -framework AppKit -framework WebKit -framework QuartzCore -o /tmp/grove-report-webkit-test
/tmp/grove-report-webkit-test examples/integrated-report.html
```

The macOS harness checks measured growth and shrinkage independent of viewport
height and the absence of script-message handlers. CI runs the equivalent
WebKitGTK and WebView2 harnesses.
